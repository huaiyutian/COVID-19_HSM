## Notes on the code

To run, you need a Matlab toolbox called "DRAM": 
DRAM is a combination of two ideas for improving the efficiency of Metropolis-Hastings type Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, Delayed Rejection and Adaptive Metropolis. This page explains the basic ideas behind DRAM and provides examples and Matlab code for the computations.(see http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/dram/)

## Data

### Epidemiological data

We collected the daily official case reports from the health commission of 34 provincial-level administrative units and 358 city-level units, the websiteâ€™s links are provided. The information was collected by Bingying Li.

### Mobility data

Human movement in China can be observed directly from mobile phone data, through the Baidu location-based services (LBS). Both the recorded movements and relative volume of inflows, outflows, inner movement among cities (n=358), were obtained from the migration flows database (http://qianxi.baidu.com/) from 1 January 2019 to 1 April 2020. Mobility data outside China is obtained from Apple Maps (www.apple.com/covid19/mobility) from 13 January 2020 to 4 July 2020, a total of 40 countries were used for analysis (See Extended Data Table 2). Baidu's LBS data was collected and processed by Dr.Ligui Wang and Dr.Hongbin Song.
